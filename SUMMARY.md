**QHDP: QUT-HIA-DAF Polytunnel Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the agricultural and robotics industries. 

The dataset consists of 687 images with 3740 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *green*, *red*, and *mixed*.

Images in the QHDP dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (345 images), *eval* (256 images), and *val* (86 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">University of Bonn, Germany</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;"> Queensland University of Technology, Australia</span>.
